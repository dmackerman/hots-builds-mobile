Make sure you have the ionic beta installed. Also make sure you have the [CORs Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) plugin installed to allow CORs from your browser.

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@beta
```

After the repo is cloned:

```bash
$ npm install
$ ionic state restore
$ ionic serve
```
